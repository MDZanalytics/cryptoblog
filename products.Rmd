We offer two types of services, (1) access to altcoin indicators and push notifications, and (2) custom data analytics.

## <br> Altcoin indicators and push notifications

The market indicators shown on this site are developed using advanced data analysis,
which is optimised for maximum profit.

We provide optimised indicators for your favourite coins, including optimised values
for moving averages, TSI, DMI, stoch and double RSI.

This is a strong system to help you grow your portfolio over time.

These market indicators are checked at the end of the daily close and if there is a flip in
momentum, then notifications are sent.
These notifications are sent to your mobile device via Pushbullet, which is nice
because you won't need to check the home page every day.

Indicators and push notifications for bitcoin, ethereum and monero are provided for free.
If you want indicators and push notifications for your favorite coins, then join the altcoin group.
For an annual fee of $100, you can access the indicators for any altcoin that has >6 months of market data.

Membership to the altcoin group is free for the rest of 2022.
