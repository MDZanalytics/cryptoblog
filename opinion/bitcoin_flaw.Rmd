## I was wrong about Bitcoin

Over the last few weeks I've come to the realisation that Bitcoin has a fatal flaw.
Since I got involved in this space in 2014, I've been dismissing this issue. 
It didn't really occur to me how problematic it was.
Subconsciously, I was in denial.

I thought bitcoin was this unstoppable phenomenon.
The most resilient computer network in history, allowing p2p commerce, disintermediating
banks, remittance providers, SWIFT and other middlemen.
Bitcoin is marketed as "open decentralized, borderless, censorship-resistant, neutral, 
interconnected and p2p cash", and this is partially true, however it is a bit more 
complicated than that.

## The fatal flaw

Let me explain what the issue is.
It is the fact that the blockchain is totally transparent.
In each block, you can see all transaction information; sender address, amount and receiver address.
You can scan the blockchain and calculate the balance of every address.

You can go to any number of websites, eg: [bitinfocharts.com](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)
and see the balance of the richest wallets, along with their recent transactions.
The activities of these parties are free for anyone to see.
Isn't that a problem?
Maybe yes, maybe no.
Let me explain.

In the Bitcoin whitepaper, it was describes as pseudonomous.
As long as you can keep your address secret, your identity remains private.

Remaining private is pretty difficult however, because everyone you interact with can see your
address, and therefore see your balance.

## Why privacy is essential

When you transact with your grocery store, pay for a bus ride, or grab a burger with cash
, what information do you reveal to them?
Not much, just the transaction amount. 
The merchant doesn't get your account number, doesn't know your balance, and doesn't know
who you have been transacting with previously.

What about your credit or debit card, which is compulsory for you E-bay or Amazon purchase?
They would get the card/account number along with the amount.

What benefit would Bitcoin provide to this scenario?
If executed on bitcoin blockchain it would be slower, more expensive and with the problems where it
reveals too much of your personal information to transaction partners.*

But the recent narrative around Bitcoin is as "digital gold", so you don't need to use it for
regular transactions, just hodl it.

This isn't really sustainable, for two important reasons.

1. If a currency has no use case as a medium of exchange, then this dramatically 
diminishes it's use case.
Much of the value of a cryptocurrency is the network effect caused by making it a
medium of exchange.
If you ask a merchant to accept payment in a currency, there's a chance they will
say yes, which will grow the network further.
No medium of exchange, no growth.

2. Even if Bitcoin is a store of value not used for everyday transactions, 
the lack of privacy remains an issue.
If you purchase coins from an exchange, they know how much you have bought
over the years.
If you take those coins to a new exchange to cash some out, then the new exchange 
can see your self-custodial wallet balance, along with all the transactions that
wallet has made over the years.
As those exchanges are highly regulated, they need to enforce know-your-customer and 
anti-money-laundering (KYC/AML) laws, which is an area that tyrannical governments
could abuse.

## Why Bitcoin will be surveiled to death

You might be in the camp which says that privacy is not that important,
and that you're happy to transact on an open ledger.
That's your choice - but hear this:
Regulated exchanges implementing KYC/AML are collecting information about their
customers including the self-custody wallets they use.
This information is being passed on to law enforcement agencies as the law requires,
and this information is passed onto chain-analysis companies with an aim to
de-anonymise the blockchain of bitcoin and other cryptos.

So far, these chain-analysis efforts have been aimed at track ransoms and stolen funds and 
prevent money laundering, which is absolutely legitimate, but my fear is that once 
these capabilities are developed enough, the veil of pseudonymity will be completely smashed.
Powerful agencies will collect enough data to be able to identify the owner of every wallet.
They will be able to surveil their citizens every transaction, as well as citizens globally,
all with the information that we provide on the transparent blockchain together with KYC
exchanges.

How powerful are such chain-analysis tools?
Well take a look at how authorities were able to recover funds from the 120,000 BTC 
[Bitfinex hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Bitfinex_hack) from 2018.
Worth $72 million at the time, those coins were at one point worth $8 billion!
So how come the thieves weren't able to simply send the funds to another exchange
and cash out to a fiat currency?
Simple - the wallets holding these funds were being constantly tracked by the authorities.
Regulated exchanges around the world knew that these wallets were black-listed, and so if 
those funds were ever deposited to an exchange, the exchange could alert authorities.
And thanks to the KYC regulations, the authorities would know who and where to call.

From the original 120,000 BTC stolen, 94,000 were able to be recovered.
See the [US Justice Department memo on the case](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency)
and [Twitter thread on the matter by @xenumonero](https://twitter.com/xenumonero/status/1491109587050975233).
The main reason the funds were able to be traced, was the totally transparent nature
of the Bitcoin blockchain.
Although the people controlling the wallet used different techniques to avoid tracking, 
but it was futile:

* making lots of small transactions to make the funds harder to trace

* using a mixer service provided by a darknet.
A mixer (aka "tumbler" or "coinjoin") is a service that mixes funds from different users and 
outputs them in an effort to make trasactions untraceable. 
[See this explainer on what a coinjoin is](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinJoin).

* using decentralised exchanges to swap between cryptocurrencies.

In the end, the suspects were caught when they tried to offload some "laundered" coins on an 
exchange in which they provided their real personal identities.

These tools don't really work, and here's why: none of these techniques actually 
obfuscate the sender and receiver addresses, it just makes the web of transactions a bit 
larger.
While this may be sufficient to stay one step ahead of law enforcement which is "manually" tracing
funds, like you might browse a spreadsheet, it is no match against automated software tools that
are specifically designed to flag specific transactions. Like in this case, when the stolen funds
are deposited to an exchange.
It doesn't matter how many times the coins are mixed, or into how many tiny amounts the funds are 
divided, as soon as those "tainted" funds hit a regulated exchange, the alarm bells are going off.

It is important to look at whether swapping into other cryptos (or "chain-hopping") provided any 
utility in this case.
If this occurs over a a centralized exchange that checks the legitimacy of coins when accepting 
deposits, then no it won't.
Further, if it was a decentralised exchange, then it is likely to leave traces on the respective
blockchains, particularly if they are both transparent.
It is interesting to note that the Bitfinex suspects did swap some bitcoins into Monero (a privacy
crypto), but those Monero funds were not tracable once they were withdrawn from exchanges, however the
trail of the bitcoin transactions was completely traced by authorities.

Again, although this is a case of good policing work to catch criminals, it highlights that
there is nowhere to hide on transparent blockchain, and that one day there may be bad actors
which are able to deanonymise wallets and target individuals.

Similarly, the recent [Canadian trucker blockade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_convoy_protest)
highlighted another very important issue.
The blockade was basically a protest against government vaccine mandates, where truckers were forced
to get vaccinated so they could continue to work.
Truckers used their vehicles to clog up inner Ottowa, which led to problems in the city and
a stand-off.
The anti-vax movement supporters used various fundraising tools to strengthen the protest, including 
GoFundMe and GiveSendGo, but the government declared the blockade an illegal protest, and with
an executive order, those fundraisers were were swiftly shut down by authorities, funds 
frozen and unlikely to be returned to the protest organisers.
To circumvent this, protest organisers began accepting bitcoin donations and the funds rolled in,
however when organisers tried to actually use those funds, by cashing it into the local currency at a
regulated exchange those funds were also frozen!
The trucker donation address has been blacklisted by the government and the exchanges had to comply.

Furthermore, as the protest were deemed illegal, the owners of the wallets who made those donations
are at risk of seeing their exchange accounts and regular bank accounts frozen.

Now I'm not saying that I support the truckers here.
For the record I think the protest was infantile and short-sighted.
But the fact that people who supported a cause are now finding themselves potentially in hot water
is potentially troubling.

What if you want to donate to other causes like Wikileaks or Sci-hub, which arguably are for the
greater good but donations are illegal in some countries.

What if you wanted to buy something deeply personal, like a medicine, psychological therapy, 
sex toy, whatever.
You don't want that info published on the blockchain for the world to see, which is the
same reason you close the bathroom door when using the toilet.

## You still think bitcoin is unconfiscatable?

It is often said that bitcoin cannot be seized, but this is overly simplistic.

![wrench attach](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png "wrench attach, from xkcd.com")

If governments, exchanges and your transaction partners can all see your balance and income,
this leaves you vulnerable to extortion.
They don't need to seize your bitcoins, if they know you're stinking rich they'll just take something
else.
In the case of criminals, they might take you or someone you love hostage.
In the case of the government, they might freeze your regular back account, or seize your house.

To avoid this type of surveillance, you need to use a currency where balances cannot be snooped on,
and where transaction sender/receiver addresses are obfuscated.
If those bad actors don't know whether you have those digital assets at all, then they won't bother to
harrass you.

## Why it's going to get worse

Bitcoin and crytos are still small fry.
At only ~$2 trillion total crypto market cap, and with the space dominated by rampant speculation,
rather than actual utility, most participants are completely ignoring the problem of privacy.
Indeed, privacy protecting crytos occupy an extremely small portion of this market - at about $10 B, or
0.5% of the total.

It seems that while folks are excited about the technological advances that blockchain provides,
they haven't stopped to think about how it would work out if cryptos became a medium of exchange 
integrated into our daily lives.

Maybe this viewpoint will change with the roll-out of central bank digital currencies around the world.
[CBDCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency) are digital currencies, but are 
controlled by a central entity (the central bank).
The central bank issues individuals with their account and can issue currency directly to individuals.
The central authority can not only see what you're doing with your funds, but can with a keystroke
subtract funds or freeze the wallet permanently.
In addition, the funds could be controlled in such a way so that they can only be spent at
"approved" retailers, or that the funds will be subject to negative interest rates, or must be spent in
a certain time period upon which the funds will become unspendable.

This would be a disaster for personal freedom, but I'm sure it would be presented by politicians as a
way to boost the economy.
naturally CBDCs are being rolled-out most rapidly in authoritarian countries, like China, where the 
CBDC can be used to control the population, in particular by contributing to a persons [social credit score](https://sociable.co/government-and-policy/chinas-digital-currency-help-ccp-punish-coerce-citizens-social-credit-system-cnas/).

Certainly the central banks *might* prevent sharing this data to third parties, but so long as
such a dataset exists it will be a huge honeypot that will attract hackers who will try to sell this
information on the dark web.

At least with the current banking system, governments at present cannot surveil all transactions,
receiving alerts from banks of suspicious activity.
In the current system, a warrant is required before funds can be frozen or seized.

Another important event that might happen in the next few years is the phasing out of cash.
Cash is on the most part untracable and resistant to surveillance.
If it were invented today, then it would be sure to be banned.
And most likely it will be phased out soon, or subject to more controls.
If cash is banned, and your only options are CBDCs and cryptos, then I can see privacy oriented
cryptos becoming more popular in future.

## Is fungibility an emerging problem for bitcoin?

Fungibility is a key characteristic of money in that one unit is interchangable for another.
Cars are not fungible because there are many makes and models, but cash is, because two $5 bills are
worth the same as a $10 bill.

I see an emerging problem with bitcoin.
It started a year or so ago when Kevin O'Leary spoke about how he only wanted to buy bitcoins that
were newly minted because then he knew they definitely wouldn't be traced back to any illicit
activity like darknet markets and could be tainted.
He also spoke about how newly minted bitcoins mined with renewable energy should be worth relatively
more than those mined with energy from fossil fuels.

We're now seeing some folks speculate that coins held by persons/governments can be blacklisted by
governments around the world.
For example, as a result of Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine there are calls for "Russian coins"
to be blacklisted from Western exchanges.

This raises the prospect that over time, separate markets for these categories of coins will emerge,
fracturing liquidity and leaving us asking "is this really money?"

## Is it game-over for Bitcoin?

One of the arguments that bitcoiners make about altcoins is that over time, any worthwhile altcoin
feature will be incorporated by Bitcoin.
Even I wrote this in an earlier post.
And yes, it is true that Bitcoin is still undergoing development, but the rate at which these changes
is made is extremely slow and incremental.
This slow pace makes sense, as the developers want to ensure that BTC is a reliable system, as it supports
billions in funds from millions of users.

This slow an incremental development process means that huge changes in blockchain structure are
not likely to happen in the near future.
The privacy issues of bitcoin were raised in the community in 2013, however precious little code
changes have been implemented to protect users privacy.

Yes there is some degree of anonymity on the lightning network, a layer two solution, however
there are doubts it will work (which I will discuss in a later post).

This lack of privacy protection on the main blockchain over the past ten years indicates to me that
privacy is not something that is a high priority for the Bitcoin developer team, and therefore
we're not likely to see any major changes in this space any time soon.

Indeed, even if it were possible for Bitcoin to magically implement private transactions, there would
be a major regulatory crack-down with exchanges delisting it, as has been [experienced by privacy coins
in Western countries](https://cointelegraph.com/news/australian-exchanges-delist-privacy-coins-amid-chainalysis-integration).

Were this to happen, then it is likely that the value would tank dramatically, which would spell 
disaster for folks using BTC as their savings.

The question now is - what is the endgame here


* Sure, layer 2 solutions can facilitate faster tranactions with lower transaction costs,
but this will be limited to small transactions


Is it possible to keep bitcoin private?

That's problematic for a currency however, because 



transfer
You can see


Sure, layer 2 solutions can facilitate faster tranactions with lower transaction costs,
but this will be limited to small transactions
