## Welcome

In the cryptocurrency markets, inexperienced investors get caught up in
fear and greed, emotions which are detrimental to investor performance.

**It is essential to have a system** that you stick to, so that these emotions don't
cloud your judgement.
Here, I provide free indicators and mobile push notifications for bitcoin and ethereum, based on years of
historical price action and careful computational optimisation.

If you want push notifications or customised analysis of
your favourite alt-coin, please visit the [product page](products.html).

No material here should be considered financial advice.

## Daily alerts for BTC and ETH

At the daily open, a script checks for changes in market momentum indicators.
These include the simple moving average, directional movement index, true strength index and the stochastic oscillator.
These indicators were refined with comprehensive backtesting as detailed in the sections below.

## Moving averages

Among the simplest approaches is to rely on market momentum by buying when price rises above a 
[moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/052014/how-use-moving-average-buy-stocks.asp)
and sell when price goes below.
The following analyses identify optimal moving average intervals for bitcoin and ether.
I have seen good results on the daily and weekly timeframes, while shorter timeframes the results were poor.

Another useful approach is to use two moving average lines. Buy when the short interval line rises above 
longer interval line and sell when it goes below.

## Directional movement indicator

There are many different indicators that measure the momentum of a market.
The [directional movement indicator (DMI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dmi.asp) is one
that quantifies the positive and negative momentum which we can take advantage of to trade cryptos like bitcoin.
In the following analysis, I test different DMI intervals to see which ones work best.

<hr>

## True strength index

Another good indicator is the [true strength index (TSI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tsi.asp),
it measures momentum on two timeframes and so it is very sensitive to early changes in momentum.
In the following analysis, I test different TSI intervals to see which ones work best.

## Stochastic oscillator

The [Stochastic oscillator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stochasticoscillator.asp) stoch for short,
is yet another momentum indicator and provided oversold and overbought signals which can be used for entry and exits.
In the following analysis, I test different stochastic intervals and parameters to see which strategy work best for BTC and ETH.

## Double RSI

The [Double RSI](https://www.trendfollowingsystem.com/double-rsi-trading-system/) is a
specific application of the relative strength indicator involving a short term and a longer term RSI line.
When the short term line breaks above the long term line it is bullish and vice-versa.
In the following analysis, I test different periods for RSI calculation to see which strategy work best for BTC and ETH.
