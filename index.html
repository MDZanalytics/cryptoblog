	<h1>MDZ Analytics</h1>

        <h3>By Mark Ziemann</h3>

        <p> This site is a portfolio of cryptocurrency data analysis.
        </p>

       	<p> In particular, I have a strong interest in backtesting technical indicators to develop simple and effective crypto trading strategies. 
The following analyses are updated on a daily basis.
No material here should be considered financial advice.

        <h3>Daily alerts for BTC and ETH</h3>

        <p>I have a script that runs before the daily close each day, looking at some trade signals for bitcoin and ether.
These include the simple moving average, directional movement indicator and true strength indicator.
These indicators were developed with comprehensive backtesting as detailed in the sections below.
        </p>

        <ul>

        </ul>

        <h3>Moving averages</h3>

	<p> Among the simplest approaches is to rely on market momentum by buying when price rises above a moving average and sell when price goes below.
The following analyses identify optimal moving average intervals for bitcoin and ether.
I have seen good results on the daily and weekly timeframes, while shorter timeframes the results were poor.
	</p>

	<ul>

		<li> <a href="crypto/ma_trading.html">Moving average strategy for bitcoin (daily)</a> </li>

                <li> <a href="crypto/ma_trading_weekly.html">Moving average strategy for bitcoin (weekly)</a> </li>

                <li> <a href="crypto/ma_trading_eth.html">Moving average strategy for ether (daily)</a> </li>

                <li> <a href="crypto/ma_trading_weekly_eth.html">Moving average strategy for ether (weekly)</a> </li>

                <li> <a href="crypto/ma_trading_ethbtc.html">Moving average strategy for ether against bitcoin (daily)</a> </li>

	</ul>

	<p> Another useful approach is to use two moving average lines. Buy when the short interval line rises above longer interval line
and sell when it goes below.

        <ul>

                <li> <a href="crypto/ma_cross.html">Moving average cross strategy for bitcoin (daily)</a> </li>

                <li> <a href="crypto/ma_cross_eth.html">Moving average cross strategy for ether (daily)</a> </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Directional movement indicator</h3>

        <p> There are many different indicators that measure the momentum of a market.
The directional movement indicator (DMI) is one that quantifies the positive and negative momentum which we can take advantage of to trade cryptos like bitcoin.
In the following analysis, I test different DMI intervals to see which ones work best.
        </p>


        <ul>
                <li> <a href="crypto/dmi_trading.html">Directional movement indicator strategy for bitcoin (daily)</a> </li>

                <li> <a href="crypto/dmi_trading_eth.html">Directional movement indicator strategy for ether (daily)</a> </li>

        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h3>True strength index</h3>

        <p> Another good indicator is the true strength index (TSI), it measures momentum on two timeframes and so it is very sensitive to early changes in momentum.
In the following analysis, I test different TSI intervals to see which ones work best.
        </p>


        <ul>
                <li> <a href="crypto/tsi_trading.html">True strength index strategy for bitcoin (daily)</a> </li>

                <li> <a href="crypto/tsi_trading_eth.html">True strength index strategy for ether (daily)</a> </li>

        </ul>
