## Preface

First and foremost, this is not financial advice.
This guide is for educational and informational purposes only.

The cryptocurrency markets are volatile and money can be made and LOST quickly.
You own the decisions you make. Big boy pants here.

What I'm discussing below are the principles behind how I manage risk and take advantage of upside
potential.
Consider speaking to a financial advisor about your personal situation and acceptable levels of risk.

## So you've decided to get involved in the crypto market?

In my earlier [blog post](https://mdz-analytics.com/crypto/learning_resources.html) I gave a general
overview as to the benefits of bitcoin. I will rehash them here briefly:

* The only truly scarce asset (with a hard cap)

* Not controlled by a central authority

* Cannot be censored

* Truly mobile

It is also worth discussing the negative points, or risks:

* Highly volatile. Often when people hear about bitcoin, it is in the middle of a market euphoria 
which is the most dangeous time to begin investing.

* Markets can be manipulated. Billionaire entrepreneurs announcements can rock the market in both ways.
Similarly, large bitcoin hodlers use their market power to cause price shifts designed to stoke the
emotions of investors.
For example continued selling causing downtrends which instills fear, where retail sell for reduced 
prices to whales who accumulate.

* Governments can impose some controls.
They can regulate the way that businesses and individuals interact with cryptos, for example by banning
mining, controlling exchanges, and banning these cryptos as a means of payment.

* Most cryptos lack privacy features.
You don't want your payees/payers to know how much you own, and you don't want this information
getting out to the whole world.
This is an issue that will become more important as cryptos become more embedded in our everyday lives.

* Technology developments in future could render bitcoin or other cryptos obsolete.
It could happen.

Based on your study and knowledge of these these risks and benefits, you need to decide how deeply you
want to get involved.

## Use the technology BEFORE you invest in it

This is such a good piece of advice.
If you were to invest in a company that makes stuff, you would want to learn as much as you could
about the products it makes.
So you try the product, test it out, see what it can do.
Compare products between companies, observe where the competitive advantage lies.

Buy a tiny amount of bitcoin (or altcoin) on an exchange, transfer it to a wallet on your PC or phone.
Use it to pay for stuff.
Request others to pay you in bitcoin.

If you are tech savvy, you can try to go a bit deeper by setting up a node.
I've recently set up a Bitcoin node and it gives you a deeper understanding about what is going on
under the hood.
It gives me a better idea about what makes the Bitcoin network resilient and what challenges it faces.
it provides a window into potential new applications, like lightning, or even apps built on top of it.
You will also better appreciate the weaknesses, for example how difficult to set these up and keep
them running smoothly

## Tips for beginner investors

Here's my top tips:

1. If you decide that you will accumulate a bit of crypto, invest some time to secure your 
funds properly.
There are lots of good guides online, but I will give you the nutshell.
Get a hardware wallet, learn how to use it. Load it with your seed phrase and protect it with a 
password that you can memorise.
You can keep a backup of your seed phrase on paper/steel in a VERY safe place, like a bank deposit box.
Review your security procedures reguarly and upgrade them as the value of the portfolio grows.
Consider how you will enable your loved ones to use the funds after you're dead.

2. Choose an exchange which meets your needs.
Consider security - is it reputable? 
Is it a long running firm with a good track record?
Consider fees for trades and withdrawals.
Consider juristiction and regulatory issues. If you reside in a country where you can't trust the 
government, then consider obtaining an account with an off-shore exchange in a country friendly to
digital asset investing.

3. Keep the majority of your funds off the exchange, in your hardware wallet.
Exchanges can get hacked sometimes, so in the chance that the exchange is compromised you won't lose 
everything.
If your strategy involves swing trades of large sums and you want to keep funds on the exchange
to protect against network fees and congestion, then consider accounts at more than one exchange.
That way, a smaller fraction of funds will be lost in case of hack.

4. Never invest more than you can afford to lose and keep a long term mindset.
Bitcoin is a long term investment, if you need the funds to secure a guaranteed income, then crypto 
probably isn't right for you.
Have a look at the 10 year chart for BTC.
You will see that the price undergoes wild swings in the relative short term, but over the long 
term it does trend up.
There are good years and bad years, but if your time horizon is four years or more, you are most 
likely going to see the purchasing power of your portfolio grow.

5. Investigate dollar cost averaging (DCA).
The market moves in wild ways.
Some say the market moves in a "maximum pain" pattern, inflicting maximum pain on both bears and bulls
as the market gets overly emotional and moves become exaggerated.
Buying a set amount at regular intervals helps to smooth out the noise of the short term moves.
Start with really small amounts, for example: how much do you spend on streaming services each month?
Then over time you can slowly increase the contributions as you learn more about the technology and 
comfortable with the way the market moves.
DCA can be set up automatically, so you can let it accumulate over time.

6. Monitor your emotions.
Do you feel euphoric when the price is going up and depressed when it's going down?
Are you checking the market moves every hour?
Is it preventing you from enjoying other parts of your life?
In that case you might have too much invested in the market, and you should consider scaling out.
A financial advisor will help you to find the right balance in your investment portfolio.
Crypto investing is very risky, so it might not be for you.

7. Keep it simple by sticking to BTC.
People new to this space open coinmarketcap.com or other websites and get amazed by the variety of
altcoins available and the massive gains that some achieve in a short amount of time.
They open a trading account during a massive bull market and buy a basket of five cryptos.
They are happy when price is going up, but when it reverses, it can be dramatic and catastrophic.
If you are monitoring so many different assets, you are spending time securing those funds,
considering your positions, checking indicators frequently, etc.
It can be stressful!
You may think this is diversificaiton, but as the market ultimately hinges on the performance of the 
major asset, BTC, it actually weakens your position.
Instead of looking at one chart, you're looking at five.
Instead of having fear that BTC will dump by 50%, you have fear that the s**tcoin could dump by 80% 
or worse!
It is always helpful to remember that BTC is the only store-of-value crypto.
All others are utility tokens; analogous to technology start-ups.
As with start-ups, it is extremely competitive - the failure rate is high.

8. Another small tip: denominate your investments in BTC, that way you don't feel like you're losing when 
the market corrects.

## Level up

So you've accumulated for a while or you've been involved in this space so long that 
you already know all those beginner tips?

Let's dive into some more advanced stuff shall we.

### Diversification done properly.

You've already decided on the weighting that cryptos should have in your net worth, and have a regular
DCA strategy, now it's time to consider different ways to hold cryptos.
The different ways are:

1. Cold storage. This should be the largest portion, which is held with the lowest risk.

2. Lend it out. You can deposit funds at a centralised cryptobank like Celcius, Ledn, Nexo, etc which
will lend out your funds and you will earn interest, paid in crypto.
The interest rates are quite good for some of these, for example ~7% pa for BTC at 
[Celcius](https://celsius.network/).
Alternatively there are decentralised finance solutions (eg: Compound) although I have not used these 
myself.
This is a good option for those with a long term horizon, although lending out your coins does involve
considerable risk.
Based on this risk, you could consider lending a small part of your portfolio (max one-third).
As the value of the account increases, you should consider dividing the funds over >1 accounts.

3. Acquire some with your retirement funds.
Depending on where you live it could be possible to stack bitcoin with your retirement savings account
(aka: superannuation).

4. Use regulated markets. There are bitcoin ETFs and other funds popping up around the place and
these could be something that it worth looking into. 
Especially if the purchase will be made as part of a retirement savings plan.
Still, the fees involved with such funds are considerable and you're still trusting them (the bank)
to secure the funds correctly.

5. You can actively trade a small portion of your portfolio.
I think we'll need a new heading for this one.

### Active trading

I'm sorry to say, but novice traders are more often than not going to get rekt by trying to trade 
short term price action.
Here's why:

1. Hype

2. Emotions

3. Influencers

How do you stop getting rekt? Get a System!

You can study the historical charts and analyse levels of support and resistance.
You can make paper trades, and work on a strategy that works for intra-day or multi-day swing strategies.
Invariably, doing this properly is time consuming which conflicts with other things in your life.
If you want to keep your full time job, you can't be looking at the charts constantly, you will need to
spend time at your job, and you might miss trading opportunities because of the job, or worse, time
spent away from the chart causes you to miss huge moves and your position goes underwater.
If you did this with leverage, there's a chance the entire position is liquidated.

My system: crunch the data with computers so I don't need to look at a chart.
