## Welcome

In the cryptocurrency markets, inexperienced investors get caught up in
fear and greed, emotions which are detrimental to investor performance.

**It is essential to have a system** that you stick to, so that these emotions don't
cloud your judgement.
Here, I provide free indicators and mobile push notifications for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero, based on
careful backtesting of historical price data.

If you want push notifications or customised analysis of
your favourite alt-coin, please visit the [product page](products.html).

No material here should be considered financial advice.

## Our indicators

#### **Moving averages**

Among the simplest approaches is to rely on market momentum by buying when price rises above a
[moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/052014/how-use-moving-average-buy-stocks.asp)
and sell when price goes below.

Backtesting (daily): [BTC](crypto/ma_trading_btc.html), [ETH](crypto/ma_trading_eth.html) and
[XMR](https://mdz-analytics.com/altcoins/XMR/ma_trading_XMR.html).

Backtesting (weekly): [BTC](crypto/ma_trading_weekly_btc.html) and [ETH](crypto/ma_trading_eth.html).

Another useful approach is to use crosses of moving average lines.
Buy when the short interval line rises above longer interval line and sell when it goes below.
Backtesting: [BTC](crypto/ma_cross_btc.html), [ETH](crypto/ma_cross_eth.html)
and [XMR](https://mdz-analytics.com/altcoins/XMR/ma_cross_XMR.html).

#### **Directional movement indicator**

There are many different indicators that measure the momentum of a market.
The [directional movement indicator (DMI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dmi.asp) is one
that quantifies the positive and negative momentum which we can take advantage of to trade cryptos like Bitcoin.
In the following analysis, I test different DMI intervals to see which ones work best.

Backtesting: [BTC](crypto/dmi_trading_btc.html), [ETH](crypto/dmi_trading_eth.html) and
[XMR](https://mdz-analytics.com/altcoins/XMR/dmi_trading_XMR.html).

#### **True strength index**

Another good indicator is the [true strength index (TSI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tsi.asp),
it measures momentum on two timeframes and so it is very sensitive to early changes in momentum.
In the following analysis, I test different TSI intervals to see which ones work best.

Backtesting: [BTC](crypto/tsi_trading_btc.html), [ETH](crypto/tsi_trading_eth.html) and
[XMR](https://mdz-analytics.com/altcoins/XMR/tsi_trading_XMR.html).

#### **Stochastic oscillator**

The [Stochastic oscillator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stochasticoscillator.asp) stoch for short,
is yet another momentum indicator and provided oversold and overbought signals which can be used for entry and exits.
In the following analysis, I test different stochastic intervals and parameters to see which strategy work best.

Backtesting: [BTC](crypto/stoch_trading_btc.html), [ETH](crypto/stoch_trading_eth.html) and
[XMR](https://mdz-analytics.com/altcoins/XMR/stoch_trading_XMR.html).

#### **Double RSI**

The [Double RSI](https://www.trendfollowingsystem.com/double-rsi-trading-system/) is a
specific application of the relative strength indicator involving a short term and a longer term RSI line.
When the short term line breaks above the long term line it is bullish and vice-versa.
In the following analysis, I test different periods for RSI calculation to see which strategy work best.

Backtesting: [BTC](crypto/rsi2_trading_btc.html), [ETH](crypto/rsi2_trading_eth.html) and
[XMR](https://mdz-analytics.com/altcoins/XMR/rsi2_trading_XMR.html).
