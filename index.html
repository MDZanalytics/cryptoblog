	<h1>MDZ Analytics</h1>

        <h3>By Mark Ziemann</h3>

        <p> This site is a portfolio of cryptocurrency data analysis.
        </p>

       	<p> In particular, I have a strong interest in backtesting technical indicators to develop simple and effective crypto trading strategies. 
The following analyses are updated on a daily basis.
No material here should be considered financial advice.

        <h3>Moving averages</h3>

	<p> Among the simplest approaches is to rely on market momentum by buying when price rises above a moving average and sell when price goes below.
The following analyses identify optimal moving average intervals for bitcoin and ether.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li> <a href="crypto/ma_trading.html">Moving average strategy for bitcoin (daily)</a> </li>

                <li> <a href="crypto/ma_trading_weekly.html">Moving average strategy for bitcoin (weekly)</a> </li>

                <li> <a href="crypto/ma_trading_eth.html">Moving average strategy for ether (daily)</a> </li>

                <li> <a href="crypto/ma_trading_weekly_eth.html">Moving average strategy for ether (weekly)</a> </li>

	</ul>

	<p> Another useful approach is to use two moving average lines. Buy when the short interval line rises above longer interval line
and sell when it goes below.

        <ul>

                <li> <a href="crypto/ma_cross.html">Moving average cross strategy for bitcoin (daily)</a> </li>

                <li> <a href="crypto/ma_cross_eth.html">Moving average cross strategy for ether (daily)</a> </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Directional movement indicator</h3>

        <p> There are many different indicators that measure the momentum of a market.
The directional movement indicator (DMI) is one that quantifies the positive and negative momentum which we can take advantage of to trade cryptos like bitcoin.
In the following analysis, I test different DMI intervals to see which ones work best.
        </p>


        <ul>
                <li> <a href="crypto/dmi_trading.html">Directional movement indicator strategy for bitcoin (daily)</a> </li>
        </ul>
